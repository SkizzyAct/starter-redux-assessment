# Starter redux assessment: Doggiegram

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## AI Usage
As per the "Pair Programming with AI assistants" lesson in this course, Github Copilot was used for minor assistance such as catching small syntax mistakes and inline suggestions.

### Available scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm install`

Installs the project dependencies, including Redux packages such as @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the React app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

Runs an Express API at `http://localhost:3004` that exposes a single endpoint, `GET /api/suggestion`, which returns a dog suggestion at random.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suites.
